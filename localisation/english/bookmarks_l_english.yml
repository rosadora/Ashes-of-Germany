 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Looming Conflagration"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bohemia is a crossroads at the center of Europe. With a serene political climate but separatist difficulties, certain tensions are emerging, notably with growing Czechoslovak sentiment. President Benes has ruled the country for several years and his party has been in power since 1925, but he will have to forge alliances to stay in power. Will this industrial and demographic cradle of Central Europe survive the turmoil sweeping across Europe?"
 SLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Slovakia is in a delicate position. Its Communist regime is in trouble with separatism, the Hungarian presence is problematic in many respects, and the threat of war hangs over the region. Bohemia's desire to unify the two countries is also a factor in the country's destabilization. Will one political current be able to stabilize the country and lead it through these troubled times?"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The UK is in a delicate but still powerful position with the largest of the colonial empires. But the country's isolation on the European stage and the rise of the far right are undermining the position of the governing Tories. What's more, France, the country's main rival, has gained the upper hand, and a confrontation is now almost inevitable."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Syria, or rather the French Mandate in Syria, is in the grip of major nationalist movements supported by the socialist countries of Europe, which will undoubtedly lead to a revolt in the near future. Which direction the Syrian people wish to take remains uncertain, between pan-Arabist, democratic or Great Syrian movements."
 PAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mandatory Palestine is on the verge of a major revolt that threatens to plunge the country into civil war. While Zionist settlers seek to proclaim a Jewish state, the Palestinian population seeks to build a state independent of the British in a pan-Arabist perspective."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whose current borders have remained unchanged since the signing of a ceasefire with Marshal Tito's forces, is in a period of long recovery. Its alliance with Romania enabled it to maintain a balance of power with the Communist bloc, but the latter was strengthening considerably. /nThe monarchy was also threatened by pro-democracy movements in the country. And the regency does little to lend legitimacy to Prince Paul's government."
 CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Marshal Tito's Croatia was not a fixed state, but the result of a long guerrilla war against the monarchist central government in Belgrade, with the aim of reclaiming the whole of Yugoslavia. The situation for the small republic was precarious: on the one hand, Tito's militarism and ambitions for a greater Balkan federation were popular with the population; on the other, the small state was a small nation with a small economy, and was hugely dependent on the health of the rest of the socialist bloc. The Italian-funded Ustasha rebellions were also a source of great instability."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan is the most modern and industrialized power in Asia. However, it is not as stable as it might appear; between the rise of ultra-nationalist factions in the military and the threat of a socialist uprising, the country is in its greatest impasse in centuries. \nThe Taisho era is over, and the transition to the Showa era seems more difficult than ever."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "§RThe current content is simply the vanilla content arranged with the timeline, so play it if you want, but don't expect the gameplay to be very different.§!"
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After years of civil war, the socialists established themselves as the rulers of Mongolia despite the Bolshevik defeat. This resulted in the country's isolation and a more pragmatic approach to the situation. \nThe social democrats of the MAN have been in power for over 10 years, but their hegemony is threatened by monarchists reorganized around Genepil and a left wing that is pushing for real revolutionary change."
