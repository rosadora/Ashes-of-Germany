 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy is in a pitiful state. Mussolini had succeeded in industrializing the country with the industrialists, but he was facing strong and growing opposition. These oppositions, which are both armed and popular, are largely financed by foreign powers such as Bavaria and France. \n\nIn an atmosphere of heavy civil war, Mussolini's dream of a Second Roman Empire seems to be slipping away. \nWho will succeed in putting Italy back on the road to prosperity?"
