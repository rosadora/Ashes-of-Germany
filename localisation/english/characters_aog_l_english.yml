 POLITICS_Vasily_Maklakov_DESC:0 "Born in Moscow in 1869, Vasily Maklakov was an important figure in one of Russia's largest parties during the Empire in the years 1900-1910. \nDuring the civil war, he was forced into exile and remained in France as a former diplomat of the Empire. \nAfter the end of Japanese military rule in Vladivostok, he decided to go there to create the Transamur Constitutional Democratic Party to build the Russian model of liberal democracy. He won the elections by a large margin in October 1929 and October 1933 and defeated Semyonov's ruling party, the Vladivostok Cossack Movement."
 POLITICS_Grigory_Semyonov_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 in Kuranzha, Grigory Semyonov became the leader of Transamur after Kolchak's departure in 1920. Initially facing considerable chaos, he eventually secured Japanese support by promising the occupiers significant privileges, notably that of redirecting part of the country's production to Japan. \nNine years later, he was finally ousted from power by the Seven Days' Revolution, which liberalized the country while remaining allied with Japan. He founded his party in 1929 in anticipation of the legislative elections but was defeated by the KDT, although he remained the leading opposition party."
 POLITICS_Pyotr_Nikiforov_DESC:0 "Born in Irkutsk in 1882, Pyotr Nikiforov served for many years as a sailor in the imperial army. He became interested in socialist and Marxist ideas and took part in the Kronstadt uprising of 1905. He was imprisoned in 1910 for sedition and released during the February Revolution, at which point he traveled to Vladivostok. When the Bolsheviks fell, he was forced to remain in Vladivostok. \nIn 1923, he founded the Vladivostok Workers' Party, which won 9% of the vote in October 1929 and 11% in 1933."
 POLITICS_YANJMAA_DESC:0 "Sühbaataryn Yanjmaa is the widow of Mongolian military hero Damdin Sükhbaatar, who helped establish the independent state of Mongolia during the Mongolian Revolution in 1922, driving out the Khan. After her husband's death, she took over as leader of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and rallied a lot of support, including from the liberal opposition against the restorationist ambitions of the Khan's supporters and within the conservative aristocracy. \n\nPolitically, she led reforms at the forefront of women's rights worldwide, with the introduction of suffrage in 1927 and the possibility of joining women's brigades in 1933. Economically, she adopted a more pragmatic approach, which she defined as “market socialism,” in order to meet the country's needs and bring it out of feudalism. She was therefore criticized by the left for sacrificing socialist ideals on the altar of development."
 POLITICS_DAMDINBAZAR_DESC:0 "Sodnomyn Damdinbazar was a key figure in Mongolian politics. He took part in the country's independence movement in 1911-1912 and then served in the Khanate's governments for several years.\nDuring the 1921 revolution, he finally changed sides, supporting the socialist revolts while expressing reservations about the future. When the Bolsheviks were no longer there to help the radical socialist revolutionaries, Sodnomyn Damdinbazar participated in the democratic transition and campaigned for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. \nWhen the Khan died and the Republic was proclaimed, he positioned himself as a moderate. He founded the Progress and Development Party in 1926, which became the main liberal force in the country, but still remained very much in the minority. \n\nFrom 1926 onwards, he provided critical support to the ruling party in opposition to the restorationists."
 POLITICS_Choibalsan_DESC:0 "Khorloogiin Choibalsan is a politician and illustrious marshal of the Mongolian army. He was one of the architects of the victory over the White Army during the 1921 revolution and now leads the main opposition group within the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. \n\nHe opposes the current leader, whom he considers “too soft” and not “radical” enough in implementing socialist policy, believing that she makes too many compromises with liberals. He represents the Bolshevik-inspired alternative to social democracy."
 POLITICS_Losol_DESC:0 "Darizavyn Losol was one of the founding members of the MPRP. \n\nDuring the 1921 revolution, he helped build the party and establish its hegemony, while remaining wary of the movement's right-wing tendencies. He was an important thinker of a comprehensive Mongolian socialist doctrine, pushing for the total socialization of the economy. He was an internationalist but realistic about the reality of the country, which led him to adopt a more isolationist strategy."
 POLITICS_GENEPIL_DESC:0 "“Queen Genepil” is the last surviving wife of the former Khan. In 1923, she decided to enter politics by participating in the founding of the Mongolian Restorationist Party. She became the figurehead of the monarchist resistance, uniting the opposition to the regime outside of the liberals, ranging from conservatives to the most virulent reactionaries.\n\nIdeologically, no one really knows what she wants; the aristocracy of the old regime sees her as a pawn who will restore the Khanate by installing a regent, but Genepil's close circle suggests that she has greater ambitions than those proposed by the aristocracy."
 illegitimate_regent:0 "Illegitimate Leader"
 POLITICS_MORDORJ_DESC:0 "Not much is known about his history, except that he was raised by the queen but was adopted. Now, he is the new Khan who will impose his own agenda."
 Kathe_Latzke_DESC:0 "Born in Königsberg in 1899 during the German Empire, she joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1923 while the region was occupied by Polish and Lithuanian troops. \n\nWithin the Communist Party, she advocated for unity among socialist forces, notably with the SPD, to denounce the occupation and organize against the rise of the local far right."
 Wilhelm_von_Gayl_DESC:0 "Wilhelm von Gayl is a staunch monarchist who decided to remain in East Prussia despite the occupation. Here, he organized a vibrant center of monarchist opposition to the occupation with a view to one day rejoining Berlin Prussia."
 Otto_Braun_DESC:0 "Born in 1872, Otto Braun was a long-standing member of the left wing and then the moderate wing of the Social Democratic Party. Since 1918, he had opposed the occupation of the region by Poland and Lithuania, but he was not known as a troublemaker.\n\nNevertheless, he succeeded in making the SPD the main opposition to the liberal Zentrum government, but without any real dynamism."
 Heinrich_Sahm_DESC:0 "Born 1877 in Pomerania, part of the German Empire, Heinrich Sahm moved to Königsberg in 1919, tasked by the Treaty of Versailles with administering the city. \n\nInitially elected as an independent mayor, he became close to the Zentrum party before joining it in 1931. He has led a liberal majority since his arrival"
 Maria_Koszutska_DESC:0 "Born in Główczyn under German occupation in 1876, Maria Koszutska was an important figure in Polish socialism. \n\nInitially a member of the left wing of the Polish Socialist Party (also known as the Youth Wing), she left in 1918 to found the Communist Party of Poland. \n\nShe watched helplessly as the Bolsheviks were defeated during the civil war. She opposed the 1926 coup d'état by Marshal Pilduski, which failed thanks in particular to the strong mobilization of party activists who rallied the working class through the strikes of May 1926 and by forming a united front with the Centrolew in the elections of 1928, 1930, and 1935."
 Boleslaw_Bierut_DESC:0 "Bolesław Bierut was born in 1892 in Lublin under the Russian Empire; he was a prominent member of the Polish Communist Party. \n\nHe was previously a member of the Polish Socialist Party, joining the party in 1918 and founding its “Leninist” wing in 1921 after the Bolshevik Revolution had been suppressed. "
 Zygmunt_Marek_DESC:0 "Zygmunt Marek was born in Krakow in 1872, then under Austro-Hungarian rule. \n\nHe was an important figure in the Polish Socialist Party, serving as Sejm Marshal from 1926 to 1930 and representing the party's more moderate wing. He opposed the coup d'état of 1926."
 Wincenty_Witos_DESC:0 "Born in Wierzchosławice in 1874, Wincenty Witos was a prominent figure in Polish politics in the 1920s. He founded the People's Party after leaving the Polish People's Party “Piast” in 1931. He opposed Pilduski's coup d'état in 1926 and participated in the center-left coalition since its formation in 1928, which prevented the ruling party from gaining an absolute majority."
 Wojciech_Korfanty_DESC:0 "Wojciech Korfanty was born in Sadzawka in German Silesia; coming from a Polish minority family, he opposed persecution by the Empire. He was the leading figure of the Catholic nationalist conservatives while opposing the authoritarianism of the Sanacja governments. "
