 POLITICS_Vasily_Maklakov_DESC:0 "Born in Moscow in 1869, Vasily Maklakov was an important figure in one of Russia's largest parties during the Empire in the years 1900-1910. \nDuring the civil war, he was forced into exile and remained in France as a former diplomat of the Empire. \nAfter the end of Japanese military rule in Vladivostok, he decided to go there to create the Transamur Constitutional Democratic Party to build the Russian model of liberal democracy. He won the elections by a large margin in October 1929 and October 1933 and defeated Semyonov's ruling party, the Vladivostok Cossack Movement."
 POLITICS_Grigory_Semyonov_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 in Kuranzha, Grigory Semyonov became the leader of Transamur after Kolchak's departure in 1920. Initially facing considerable chaos, he eventually secured Japanese support by promising the occupiers significant privileges, notably that of redirecting part of the country's production to Japan. \nNine years later, he was finally ousted from power by the Seven Days' Revolution, which liberalized the country while remaining allied with Japan. He founded his party in 1929 in anticipation of the legislative elections but was defeated by the KDT, although he remained the leading opposition party."
 POLITICS_Pyotr_Nikiforov_DESC:0 "Born in Irkutsk in 1882, Pyotr Nikiforov served for many years as a sailor in the imperial army. He became interested in socialist and Marxist ideas and took part in the Kronstadt uprising of 1905. He was imprisoned in 1910 for sedition and released during the February Revolution, at which point he traveled to Vladivostok. When the Bolsheviks fell, he was forced to remain in Vladivostok. \nIn 1923, he founded the Vladivostok Workers' Party, which won 9% of the vote in October 1929 and 11% in 1933."
