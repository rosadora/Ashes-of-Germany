 bohemia.1.t:0 "A Crucial Vote"
 bohemia.1.d:0 "The atmosphere is electric, both in parliament and on the streets, as MPs prepare to open the debate on the possible recognition of Slovakian statehood. This would implicitly signal a move away from the prospect of unification, or at least by this majority. The far-right NS party and its supporters from various organizations are demonstrating in the streets to put pressure on the deputies, and President Benes has instructed the administrations to mobilize sufficient police forces to prevent outbursts, but intelligence fears that this may not be enough."
 bohemia.1.a:0 "Be careful"

 news.3065.d:0 "Bohemia was in turmoil during the vote on the law recognizing Slovakia as an independent state.

The putsch succeeded."
