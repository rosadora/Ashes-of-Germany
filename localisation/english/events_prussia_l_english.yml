The Zemsky Sobor has graciously bestowed the title of Tsar onto me. Marshal Anton Denikin. I, of course, gladly accepted this appointment. I will never let Russia fall into a civil war again. The liberal leftist decadent ideology will never taint our mighty Russia. I swear to you, I will do my best to restore our place among the powers of the world.”\n\nAfter his short speech, now Tsar Denikin quickly returned to the Kremlin.
