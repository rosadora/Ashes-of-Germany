Enshrined in the constitution in 1799, its officers were elected by the population and could not serve two successive terms, confirming its status as a national, democratic security force. Its role was to ensure the maintenance of law and order in each commune in times of peace, as well as the military defense of the country in times of war, as a complement to the regular army. It existed under all political regimes in France until it was dissolved in July 1871, in the wake of the communalist uprisings it supported and the repression of the Paris Commune. We're going to reinstate it to ensure an income for everyone, and to enable everyone to serve the revolution."
