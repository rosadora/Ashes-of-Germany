 bastion_of_democracy:0 "The Last Bastion of Democracy"
 bastion_of_democracy_desc:0 "Bohemia is now surrounded by authoritarian regimes, and throughout Europe, the authoritarian and nationalist plague is spreading. We are the last guarantors of democracy in Central Europe."
 german_speaking_minorities_cze:0 "German-Speaking Minorities"
 german_speaking_minorities_cze_desc:0 "German-speaking minorities are not fully integrated into the Bohemian political project or the system as a whole.

Discontent in these regions is causing a slowdown in the economy, and is a direct brake on the country's development."
 revanchism_for_unification:0 "Czechoslovak Nationalism"
 revanchism_for_unification_desc:0 "Since the defeat in the war against Hungary in 1920, Czechoslovakia has dissolved and Slovakia has fallen into the Hungarian fold. Today, Czechoslovak nationalist currents are stirring up the political scene with a view to unification."
